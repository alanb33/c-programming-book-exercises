These are my attempts at completing the exercises of Brian Kernighan and 
Dennis Ritchie's <i>C Programming Language</i>, 2nd edition.

The book itself isn't available here! Just my attempts at completing the
exercises, since I find C to be a very interesting language to work with.

I also decided to include my commentaries; plans for how to approach the
problems and my thoughts and troubles that occured afterward. If you are
not interested in this commentaries. I don't blame you -- they can be
pretty lengthy. 

Maybe someone out there might find my solutions interesting!
