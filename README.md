These are my attempts at completing the exercises of Brian Kernighan and 
Dennis Ritchie's <i>C Programming Language</i>, 2nd edition.

The book itself isn't available here! Just my attempts at completing the
exercises, since I find C to be a very interesting language to work with.

Maybe someone else might find my solutions interesting!
